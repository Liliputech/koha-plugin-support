# Koha support plugin

This plugin is meant to provide an easy way of reporting support issues in Koha. Once installed, it is accessable via a button in the lower right hand corner of the screen. Clicking on the button opens a slide-in panel which allows the user to fill in support information.

Some information, such as borrowernumber and check-outs will be automatically collected.
